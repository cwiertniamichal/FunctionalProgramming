# FunctionalProgramming
Mini compiler of C's language subset

To setup your own project, you need Stack tool instaled:
https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#windows
Note: you need to add stack's installation directory to your system path (default: C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\local\bin)

To generate docs:
haddoc -h -o output_dir Lexer.hs parser.hs 
Though it is no loonger needed, as it suffices to type 'stack test' command
